# Backbase Front End Assignment: Make A Transaction

I've spent a little over 4 hours on this task as advised. I believe that it is around 30% done.

I've put the emphasis on making sure that the progress is logged via git commits and that the existing functionality is working and thoroughly unit tested. 

#### In order to run the mock server and the application please execute:
`npm run start`

#### In order to run the unit tests please execute:
`npm run test`
